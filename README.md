# BSOD for Linux

We think it's unfair, especially looking at the current Crowdstrike situation, that only Windows users can chill and wait for someone to fix things up - so we wanted to give Linux users the same rights.

*** The System will be rebooted after ~40 seconds ***

To install:
```
./install.sh
```

To uninstall:
```
./uninstall.sh
```

Tested on Fedora 40. PRs welcome.
